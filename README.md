# Data-Algo


Divide & Conquer: with recursion

1. Divide problem into several smaller subproblems

2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively
Base case: solve small enough probloems bt brute force

3. Combine the solutions to get a solution to the subproblems
and finally a solution to the original problem
