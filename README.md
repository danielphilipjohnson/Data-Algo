# Data-Algo


##Divide & Conquer: with recursion

1. Divide problem into several smaller subproblems

2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively
Base case: solve small enough probloems bt brute force

3. Combine the solutions to get a solution to the subproblems
and finally a solution to the original problem



## Memo

1. Make it work.
- visualise the problem as a tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it 

2. make it efficient
- add a memo object
- add a base case to return memo values
- store return values into the memo
